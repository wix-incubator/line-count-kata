# Counting Code Lines

Hey, to make the summer weeks more interesting we are trying out the coding challenge.

The challenge is to create an utility which counts the number of actual lines of code. That means that empty lines & lines with comments only should be excluded from the result.

There are plenty of test cases in the `test/fixtures` directory. The challenge is to try to make as many
tests green as possible.

Run `yarn test-watch` to start mocha watcher. Fixture format is `FIXTURE_NAME.EXPECTED_LENGTH.txt`.

In case you find any issue with the tests files please notify us, so others don't get stuck on it. On top of it, if you think of additional cases that are not covered by tests feel free to share about it.

When the time ends we will do a call and discuss the results. Make it fast/pretty/ugly, it is up to you.

Hope you will enjoy it :)
